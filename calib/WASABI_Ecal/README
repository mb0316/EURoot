1. Run merge.cc : merge WASABI data file and EURICA data file in order to TS correlation.
2. Run WASABI_1.cc : build SiEcal_hist.root file storing ADC spectra for every single channels.
3. Run WASABI_2.cc : calibrate energy usign SiEcal_hist.root file for each channel and save gain and offset in WASABI_gain/ directory for every each channel.
4. Run WASABI_3.cc : build SiEcal_calib_hist.root file to check calibrated energy spectra.
5. Run WASABI_4_iden.cc : calibrate one by one using energy spectrum(Eg+Esi) and save results in WASABI_gain/ directory.
6. Run WASABI_5.cc : build SiEcal_calib_hist_final.root file to check the results.
7. Run WASABI_6.cc : calculate offset only for each layer not for every channel and save results in WASABI_modi.dat file.
8. Run WASABI_7.cc : build SiEcal_calib_hist_final_2.root file to check the results and save final gains and offsets in ../WASABI_gain.dat file.
